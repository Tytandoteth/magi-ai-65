# Magi AI Architecture Documentation

## Overview
Magi AI is a DeFAI (Decentralized Finance Augmented by Artificial Intelligence) agent that provides real-time market insights and automated financial guidance. The system is built on a modular architecture with several key components working together.

## Core Components

### 1. High-Level Planner (HLP)
The HLP is responsible for strategic decision-making and determines the best course of action based on:
- User input analysis
- Market context evaluation
- Historical performance metrics
- Engagement feedback

### 2. Low-Level Planner (LLP)
The LLP translates high-level decisions into executable tasks by:
- Selecting appropriate functions/skills
- Managing task execution
- Handling error cases
- Providing execution feedback

### 3. Memory Management
Handles persistent storage of:
- Chat history
- Market data
- User preferences
- Performance metrics

### 4. Chat Interface
Provides real-time interaction through:
- Message handling
- Response formatting
- Feedback collection
- Error management

## Data Flow
1. User Input → Chat Interface
2. Chat Interface → HLP
3. HLP → LLP
4. LLP → Specific Functions
5. Functions → Memory Management
6. Results → Chat Interface

## Database Schema
The application uses Supabase for data persistence with the following key tables:
- chat_conversations: Stores conversation contexts
- chat_messages: Individual message storage
- ai_agent_metrics: Performance tracking
- market_data: Financial metrics storage

## API Integration
Integrated services include:
- CoinGecko: Token pricing
- DefiLlama: Protocol metrics
- Etherscan: Blockchain data
- Twitter: Social engagement

## Error Handling
The system implements multiple layers of error handling:
- Component-level error boundaries
- Service-level error catching
- API failure fallbacks
- User feedback mechanisms
